NAME
====

cegwctl - CAN - Ethernet Gateway Control Utility

SYNOPSIS
========

**cegwctl** [ **-f** | **--can-fd** ] [ **-t** *TYPE* |
**--type**=*TYPE* ] [ **-b** | **--bidirectional** ] **add** **route**
*SRC* *DST*

**cegwctl** [ **-f** | **--can-fd** ] [ **-t** *TYPE* |
**--type**=*TYPE* ] **add** **dev** [*NAME*]

*TYPE* := { **none** | **eth** | **net** | **udp** | **tcp** }

**cegwctl** **del** **route** *ID*

**cegwctl** **del** **dev** *NAME*

**cegwctl** **route**

DESCRIPTION
===========

Control Utility for the `ce_gw` Kernel Programm.

OPTIONS
=======

**-b**, **--bidirectional**
>    If you add a route from SRC to DST, there will be also add the same
    route back from DST to SRC.

**-f**, **--can-fd**
>    A Flag for the larger CAN-FD Frames.

**-t**, **--type**=*TYPE*
>    Set The Type of the Gateway. '**net**' is the Default. **udp**,
    **tcp** are not supported yet.

*TYPE* := { **none** | **eth** | **net** | **udp** | **tcp** }
>    Types

COMMANDS
========

**add route** *SRC* *DST*
>    Add a Gateway from *SRC* to *DST*, where SRC and DST are the String
    names of the Interfaces.

**add dev** [*NAME*]
>    Add a virtual ethernet device. You need this device for adding a
    route. *NAME* will be the name of the new device. If you don't set
    *NAME*, it will be called \`cegw%d\`, where %d is a consecutive
    number. With the options [ **-f** | **--can-fd** ] [ **-t** *TYPE* |
    **--type**=*TYPE* ] you can set a meaningfull MTU.

<!-- -->

	| TYPE | FD? | BYTE | MTU Size Description     |
	|------|-----|------|--------------------------|
	| NONE | --  | 1500 | Standart Ethernet MTU    |
	| ETH  | NO  | 8    | Max CAN Payload          |
	| ETH  | YES | 64   | Max CAN-FD Payload       |
	| NET  | NO  | 16   | Max CAN Frame            |
	| NET  | YES | 72   | Max CAN-FD Frame         |
	| UDP  | --  | 1500 | Standart Ethernet MTU    |
	| TCP  | --  | 1500 | Standart Ethernet MTU    |

**del route** *ID*
>    Deletes the Gateway with *ID*.

**del dev** *NAME*
>    Deletes a previously with **add** **dev** added device with *NAME*
    as name.

**route** [*ID*]
>    List active Gateways and Informations or if *ID* is specified,
    Information of the Gateway with *ID* will printed

EXAMPLES
========

#### Add a Gateway:

    cegwctl -f -t net add route "eth0" "can0"

EXIT STATUS
===========

**0**
>    success

**!=0**
>    failure
